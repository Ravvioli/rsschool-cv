# Code example

The automaton processes the natural pure N(128 <= N <= 255) according to the following algorithm

1. An eight-bit binary record of the number N is constructed.
2. All digits of the binary record are replaced by opposite digits (0 -> 1, 1 -> 0.
3. The resulting number is converted to decimal notation
4. The obtained number is subtracted from the original number and the difference is displayed on the screen.

What number should be entered into the automaton so that the result is 105?

Solution

```
print([a for a in range(128,256) if (a-(a^255))==105])
```
